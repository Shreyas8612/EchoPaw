a tide that is taking me under. Swallowing sand with nothing to say, my voice drowned out in the thunder. But I won't cry, and I won't start to crumble, whenever they try to shut me or cut me down.
I won't be silenced, you can't keep me quiet, won't tremble when you try it. All I know is I won't go speechless, cause I'll breathe when they try to suffocate me. Don't you underestimate me, cause I know that I won't go speechless.
Written in stone, every rule, every word, centuries old and unbending. Staking your place, better seen and not heard, but now that story is ending. Cause I, I cannot start to crumble.
So come on and try, try to shut me and cut me down. I won't be silenced, you can't keep me quiet, won't tremble when you try it. All I know is I won't go speechless.
Speechless of the summit, I cannot be broken. No, I won't live unspoken, cause I know that I won't go speechless. Try to lock me in this cage, I won't just lie me down inside.
I will take these broken wings and watch me burn. Can't get up to say I won't be silenced, so you won't see me tremble when you try it. All I know is I won't go speechless.
Speechless, cause I'm free when they try to suffocate me. Don't you underestimate me, cause I know that I won't go speechless. All I know is I won't go speechless.
